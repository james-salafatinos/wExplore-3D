# Welcome to wExplore-3D
## What is it?
#### wExplore-3D is a system of tools designed to browse wikipedia and other dense networks in a more interesting way.


## üöÄ Demo

## üí• Usage

Generalized dense networks including, Wikipedia, social networks, academic citations, or function call stacks in codebases. 
Wikipedia topics

## üßê Features
1. Drag and drop common JSONs to render any graph
2. Integration with custom wikipedia scraping API
3. Integration with ForceAtlas2 Layout computation
4. 3D Web based interface and layout
5. GPU rendered graphics in the browser (ability to view medium to large graphs)

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/james-salafatinos/wExplore-3D.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    **Note**: Ensure Microsoft C++ Build Tools are installed: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019, as Cython is a dependency for optimized ForceAtlas2 python library (fa2).

3. Edit the `config.json` file to reference your filepath(s) and graph name(s)

4. (Optional) Use the embedded custom Wikipedia API to extract
    ```
    py utils/wScrape.py Tom_Corbett,_Space_Cadet --write_to 'data_test.gexf'
    py utils/embed.py data/data.gexf --write_to 'data_test.json'
    npm start
    ```
    (Optional) Running a different version of Python installed on your system, for example, Python3.7 usage:
    ```
    C:\Users\jsalafatinos\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe utils/wScrape.py Tom_Corbett,_Space_Cadet --write_to 'data_test.gexf'
    ```

## Todo
[ ] Update CSS3D spawned web pages to be dynamically associated to the node (looking at the label and the label name for the URL component)
[ ] Modularize the code
[ ] Update the API CLI to enable scraping multiple levels (right now it only scrapes one)
[ ] Create an API for ForceAtlas2
[ ] Update Readme for installation
[ ] Update socket connection to not paste an object at every time step but rather move the player around
[ ] Update ability to fly to a node and press a key to pull up some shared collaboration platform (i.e., notion.so, google doc, etc., for real time meta collaboration)
[ ] Ensure requirements.txt is pristine
[ ] Ensure package.json is pristine, and package-lock.json is not in file upload
[X] Add GUI controls for graph edge and node filtering and fly speed
[ ] Edge bundling: Filter the number of edges so we don't have to render as many nodes
[ ] Attribute information showing: To be able to pass in an object of attributes via the .json graph viz file format, and then the wExplore world show the attributes on command. Example: fly up to a node, press KeyV and then it pulls up a little text window of the attributes shown.
